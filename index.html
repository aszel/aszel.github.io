Welcome<br>
I am Martin and I do stuff.<br>
This here is my playground in the interwebs. I am into IT stuff in general and spend most of my leisure time riding my
road bike around Berlin. Sometimes I drop some lines about what I find interesting. Mostly this here is just my place
for website related stuff where I can play with code. You can find some images from back in the days when I used
to have other hobbies than hanging in front of a screen. There is no real reason for this website. That name comes from
a comic figure named aszel. He is one of the Crackrangers of Shek, an oldschool writer from Berlin.<br><br>
