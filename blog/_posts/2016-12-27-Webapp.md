I read an <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/12/the-not-so-secret-powers-of-the-mobile-browser/" target="_blank">
article</a> recently about Chrome and downloadable websites. It turned out that it takes only one file to to a website to
make it an "app". Well, technically not a real app but who cares?! So all I did was adding a file named "manifest.json"
to the root folder of this website. If you want you can add this website to your mobile (not on IOS AFAIK). All you have
to do is

1. open this website in Chrome
2. open the menu on the top right
3. choose add to home screen

Now you should have an additional button somewhere on your mobile.
